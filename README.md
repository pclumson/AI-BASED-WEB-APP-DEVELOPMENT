# AI-BASED-WEB-APP-DEVELOPMENT
AI-based web app that performs analytics on customer feedback for their signature products. To accomplish this requirement, you will create an Emotion Detection system that processes feedback provided by the customer in text format and deciphers the associated emotion expressed.

Scenario:

You have been hired as a software engineer by an e-commerce company to create an AI-based web app that performs analytics on customer feedback for their signature products. To accomplish this requirement, you will create an Emotion Detection system that processes feedback provided by the customer in text format and deciphers the associated emotion expressed.

In this project, we use the embeddable Watson AI libraries to create an emotion detection application.

Emotion detection extends the concept of sentiment analysis by extracting the finer emotions, like joy, sadness, anger, and so on, from statements rather than the simple polarity that sentiment analysis provides. This makes emotion detection a very important branch of study and businesses use such systems widely for their AI based recommendation systems, automated chat bots, and so on.

Tasks and objectives:

    Task 1: Fork and Clone the project repository
    Task 2: Create an emotion detection application using Watson NLP library
    Task 3: Format the output of the application
    Task 4: Package the application
    Task 5: Run Unit tests on your application
    Task 6: Deploy as web application using Flask
    Task 7: Incorporate Error handling
    Task 8: Run static code analysis
